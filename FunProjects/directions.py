'''Direction Catastrophe'''

'''A very simple problem with many different solutions, but the main aim is to solve it in the most efficient way. A man was given directions to go from point A to point B. The directions were: “SOUTH”, “NORTH”, “WEST”, “EAST”. Clearly “NORTH” and “SOUTH” are opposite, “WEST” and “EAST” too. Going to one direction and coming back in the opposite direction is a waste of time and energy. So, we need to help the man by writing a program that will eliminate the useless steps and will contain only the necessary directions. 
For example: The directions [“NORTH”, “SOUTH”, “SOUTH”, “EAST”, “WEST”, “NORTH”, “WEST”] should be reduced to [“WEST”]. This is because going “NORTH” and then immediately “SOUTH” means coming back to the same place. So we cancel them and we have [“SOUTH”, “EAST”, “WEST”, “NORTH”, “WEST”]. Next, we go “SOUTH”, take “EAST” and then immediately take “WEST”, which again means coming back to the same point. Hence we cancel “EAST” and “WEST” to giving us [“SOUTH”, “NORTH”, “WEST”]. It’s clear that “SOUTH” and “NORTH” are opposites hence canceled and finally we are left with [“WEST”].
